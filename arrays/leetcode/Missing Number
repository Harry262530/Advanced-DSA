Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int> &nums) {
        int sum=0;
        int n=nums.size();
        int total=n;
        total*=n+1;
        total/=2;
        for (auto x:nums){
            sum+=x;
        }
        return total-sum;
    }
};
